							<h3>Vodka</h3>
							<div style="float:right;"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/content/vodka.jpg"/></div>
							<p>Vodka is a spirit that can be distilled from any substance that presents starch or sugar. The most commonly used substances are cereal base, potato flour and pulp.</p>

							<p>It is considered as the traditional Russian and Polish alcoholic beverage, where the ideal rate of alcohol should be 38%, as indicated by the Russian chemist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev" target="parent">Dmitri Mendeleev.</a></p>

							<p>Vodka is now the most popular alcoholic beverage in the world and there are plenty of brands: for example, just Poland produces over a thousand different Vodkas.</p>

							<p>The highest consumption by country is registered in East Europe and in the Scandinavian countries, where Vodka has a centuries-old tradition, and in the U.S.A. and Western Europe, where its widespread use has relatively recent origins.</p>

							<p>The word "Vodka" derives from the contraction of the Slavic word "водичка" [vodichka] that is the diminutive of the corresponding English word "water".</p>

							<p>The first written appearance of this word came from Poland in 1405. In a Sandomierz Voivodato register (Sandomierz Voivodato was an administrative division and local government unit of the Kingdom of Poland from the fourteenth century, until the partition of Poland in 1772-1795 between the Russian Empire, the United Kingdom of Prussia and the House of Habsburgs of Austria) was found the name "little water", that probably meant euphemistically a distillate light and clean in taste but certainly not in the alcohol volume.</p>

							<p>Vodka has also others names, all with the same root the means "burnt": in the Belarusian "Гарэлка" [Garelka]; in Polish "Gorzałka"; in Ukrainian "Горілка" [Gorilka].</p>

							<p>In 1520 only in Gdansk, Poland, there were already sixty official distilleries, not counting the clandestine ones.</p>

							<p>In Russia the first document related to Vodka dates back to 1649 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_of_Russia" target="parent">Czar Alexei</a> promulgated an imperial code to regulate the production, permitting the noble landowners to hold a still for small productions for private consumption.</p>

							<p>In 1533 the name Vodka appeared in a medical prescription brought from Poland to Russia by a merchant from the zone of the ancient Kievan Rus', a medieval monarchy founded in the late ninth century in an area where today there are Ukraine, western Russia, Belarus, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and eastern Estonia, considered the oldest East Slavic organized state, which has for a long time the capital in Kiev.</p>

							<p>Only on 8 June 1751 in a decree by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_I_of_Russia" target="parent">Empress Catherine I</a>, which regulated the ownership of some distilleries, the word Vodka was written by giving it the modern meaning.</p>

							<p>In the West, Vodka became popular first in the U.S.A. where, in 1930, Vladimir Smirnoff, of the future Smirnoff company, worked with with Rudolph Kunett, a Russian immigrant whose family was the spirits supplier for Smirnoff before the October 1917 revolution, to organize the trade of Vodka in North America.</p>

							<p>In 1938 Kunett, not having the necessary funds to carry on the operation that did not seem profitable as it was thought, sold the rights of Smirnoff to John G. Martin, president of Heublein, a small American factory of spirits.</p>

							<p>It was the owner of Heublein that gave Vodka the image it still keeps today.</p>

							<p>The entrepreneurial idea of Martin was to market a neutral spirit that would lend itself well to being mixed with other ingredients dissasociating significantly from the traditional Russian drink, with full character, served straight and ice-cold as an accompaniment to food.</p>

							<p>The advertising of the product emphasized the enormous versatility of this drink with clean and refined taste, in contrast with the stronger and full-bodied Bourbon, Gin and Whiskey.</p>

							<p>The idea of a pure and sophisticated distillate, that can give strength to the juices and sodas or to instil vitality and vigor in sweet liquors such as Vermouth, was an immediate success.</p>

							<p>In the 50s, slogans and posters were launched focusing on the versatility of this distillate destined to become one of the spirits of the future in the world. A well-known image depicted an inviting cocktail, a result of the marriage between dry Martini and Vodka, with the imposing pyramid of Cheops in the background. Others exploited famous movie stars to publicize the drink. The tradition of associating Vodka to monuments and famous faces survives today; for example, the Smirnoff company portrayed near the colossal anthropomorphic statues of Easter Island or the Statue of Liberty.</p>

							<p>The message is clear: it is an international drink without time and space.</p>

							<p>Once fermented, various distillations are carried out: this process brings the alcohol content and aroma level to the desired threshold.</p>

							<p>To delete unwanted notes the distillate is filtered to obtain a neutral product by using activated carbon or diamond dust, diatomaceous earth, etc.</p>

							<p>Sometimes, rather than to filter, it is possible to make a greater number of distillation to obtain an ethyl alcohol, which maintains also the characteristic aromas.</p>

							<p>After these processes the water is added, that may be rainwater, distilled or spring water, giving life to Vodka.</p>

							<p>Vodka is usually divided into two big categories: Vodka pure and aromatic.</p>

							<p>The used ingredients, therefore, are the factors that contribute most to give it the characteristic taste and aroma. To know the products from which it came it is essential to be able to appreciate it better:</p>

							<p>Cereals< br />
								Rye is the grain traditionally used in the Vodka production, especially in Eastern Europe. In Russia, its use was almost exclusive until 1870, following the use of cereals and other plant such as potatoes became increasingly common, especially in time of economic crisis.</p>

							<p>Rye<br />
							 	Rye, of which Poland is the biggests producer, even if mixed with other grain in the first wort such as wheat, oats and barley, is the main ingredient of the best Russian Vodka with soft, sweet and delicate flavor and unique taste.</p>

							<p>Wheat,<br />
								Elsewhere, wheat, which is cheaper and more popular, replaced rye. The best quality of wheat, from North America and Western Europe, decomposes easily, allowing a rapid process of transformation of complex starches to fermentable sugars.</p>

							<p>These varieties allow distillers to obtain high levels of purity, a highly desirable requirement;</p>

							<p>Potatoes< br />
								Potatoes, though considered an ingredient of the second category, have been used for centuries in many eastern countries, like Ukraine. They have some disadvantages: they allow a lower yield than cereals, a ton of potatoes gives 30% of Vodka less than the same quantity of wheat, the division into constituents is more difficult and, during the fermentation, releases waste products that are complicated to remove during the process of alcohol rectification.</p>

							<p>Vodka made from potatoes is heavier and has a stronger and more complex flavor than those made with wheat.</p>

							<p>Today, however, the progress in agriculture and distillation allows distilleries to obtain a good-quality Vodka, appreciated especially by those who like the strong flavors.</p>

							<p>Water, that constitutes 60% of the liquid contained in most of the bottles of Vodka, is softened by reducing dissolved salt content, it should contain less than 0.0042g of dissolved salts per 1.2l to be as pure as distilled water. This process is carried out by directing it in deionizators and then pumping it through layers of sand or activated carbon to purify it further.</p>

							<p>In the past, in the absence of these techniques, the distilled water was used very much, although a produced Vodka was more opaque and with less bright flavor.</p>

							<p>The described stage is fundamental for the realization of a good Vodka, since the addition of polluted or not perfectly pure water to a rectified distillate compromines its aroma and delicate flavor and roils the clear aspect: certain materials, such as iron, change color from contact with decayed water, altering the shade and doing the same with the distillate at which it is added.</p>

					  	<h3>Whisky</h3>
					  	<div style="float:right;"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/content/whiskey.jpg"/></div>
					  	<p>Whisky indicates grain spirits produced in Scotland, Canada and Japan. To be defined as such it must mature for at least 3 years in cask.</p>
					  	
					  	<h3>Canadian Whisky</h3>
					  	<p>Canadian Whisky is a product obtained from the assembling of a Whisky produced mainly with rye combined with mild distillates of other cereals. Usually the percentage of used rye does not exceed 30%. For this reason, it is often used in cocktails to replace the American "Rye Whiskey" (with at least 51% rye), more difficult to find.</p>

					  	<p>The character of Canadian Whisky lies in the quality of used grain (rye, wheat, corn, barley), in the purity of water and in the use of a particular distillation that provides continuous stills or a "passing" in pot stills called "doublers".</p>

					  	<p>The aging in new and old barrels varies between the legal minimum of three years and the maximum of twelve for the "deluxe" quality.</p>
					  	
					  	<h5>Irish Whisky</h5>
					  	<p>Irish whiskey was once the most popular spirit in the world, though a long period of decline from the late 19th century onwards greatly damaged the industry. So much so, that although Ireland boasted over 30 distilleries in the 1890s, a century later, this number had fallen to just three. However, Irish whiskey has seen a great resurgence in popularity since the late twentieth century, and has been the fastest growing spirit in the world every year since 1990. With exports growing by over 15% per annum in recent years, existing distilleries have been expanded and a number of new distilleries constructed. As of early 2017, Ireland now has sixteen distilleries in operation, with at least a further fourteen in the planning stages. However, only five of these have been operating long enough to have products sufficiently aged for sale, and only one of which was operating prior to 1975.</p>

					  	<h5>Japanese Whisky</h5>
					  	<p>Japanese whisky is a style of whisky developed and produced in Japan. Whisky production in Japan began around 1870, but the first commercial production was in 1924 upon the opening of the country's first distillery, Yamazaki. Broadly speaking the style of Japanese whisky is more similar to that of Scotch whisky than other major styles of whisky.

						<p>There are several companies producing whisky in Japan, but the two best-known and most widely available are Suntory and Nikka. Both of these produce blended as well as single malt whiskies and blended malt whiskies, with their main blended whiskies being Suntory kakubin (square bottle), and Black Nikka Clear. There are also a large number of special bottlings and limited editions.</p>

					  	<h5>Scotch Whisky</h5>
					  	<p>Alcoholic drink produced in Scotland obtained from the distillation of cereals.</p>
					  	<p>The Scotch Whisky Act of 1988 came into force in 1990, defines "Scotch Whisky" a Whisky with the following characteristics: it must be produced in a distillery in Scotland with water and malted barley, with the addition of only whole grains of other cereals, and everything must be soaked at the distillery; converted into a fermentable substrate only by endogenous enzyme systems; fermented only with the addition of yeast; must be distilled at an alcoholic volume of less than 94.8% so that the distillate has an aroma and taste derived from the raw materials used in the production; must be seasoned in a customs warehouse in Scotland in oak casks of capacity not exceeding 700 liters for a period not less than 3 years; must preserve the color, the aroma and flavor given by the used raw materials and by the method of production and aging; must not have the addition of substances other than water and caramel.</p>
					  	
					  	<p>The Scotch Whisky Act 1988 prohibits, among other things, the production of Whisky in Scotland that is not Scotch.</p>
					  	<p>The Scotch Whisky Act 1988 and the European Community legislation also specifies a minimum alcoholic strength by volume of 40% applicable to all bottled Scotch and/or sold in the Community or exported from it.</p>

					  	<p>The name derives from the Gaelic translation of the Latin aqua vitae, that is uisge beatha, which deformed in usque, then became a Whiskey and Whisky.</p>
					  	<p>The first document that speaks of a barley distillate in Scotland is the Scottish Exchequer Roll, dated 1494, which sets the supply of "Eight bolls (about one ton) of malt to Friar John Cor wherewith to make aqua vitae" ("boll" was a Scottish measure equivalent to about 25 kg).</p>
					  	<p>It seems that already Henry II of England, when he invaded Ireland in 1172, discovered that the practice of grain distilling was usual.</p>
					  	<p>In the sixteenth century with the advent of the Protestant Reformation, the monasteries were suppressed and this led to the spread of the art of distilling out of the monastic communities and the subsequent progress.</p>
					  	<p>It was discovered that with multiple distillations the obtained product is more refined: R. Holinshead, in his Chronicles of 1578, distinguishes the simplex, obtained after two distillations, the composite - after three distillations and the perfectissima  - after four.</p>
					  	<p>The enormous spread it had in that time is testified by an Act of the Scottish Parliament of 1579 which forbade the distillation of the Aqua Vitae, with the exception of that produced for personal use, as this was impacting negatively on the supply of cereals for food.</p>
					  	<p>In 1786, only in Edinburgh, it seems that for eight declared distilleries existed at leat 400 underground. The peak of this situation was reached during the visit of King George IV in 1822 to the Scottish capital, who, wearing for the occasion the typical dress of the Highlands, asked a Glenlivet claiming not to drink other, but at the time, the Glenlivet was a Scotch Whisky distilled illegally!</p>
					  	<p>So in 1823 the Royal Commission promulgated the "Law for the elimination of illicit distilling," the Excise Act: in England the duty and the import restrictions were decreased in order to encourage the authorized distillation.</p>
					  	<p>At the beginning of the next century the Duke of Gordon, owner of large territories in Scotland, was among the first to accept the reform and to encourage his tenants and, in 1824, George Smith of Glenlivet, under the tutelage of the Duke, took the first official license for distillation.</p>
					  	<p>In the two years immediately following Robert Stein invented the first continous still or column still, called patent still, where the distillation was done in one step. The device was perfected by Aeneas Coffey, who created a more efficient version with two distillation columns. The Coffey still was used by all types of cereals distilleries of Lowlands.</p>
					  	<p>In 1865 was issued the Blendig Act, that marks the beginning of a new era for Scotch Whisky since officially gave birth to a drink made by mixing the Whisky of the Highlands, from the very strong taste, and those of the Lowlands, fairly neutral and without character.</p>
					  	<p>The blended had a great success, creating a large commercial competition between the distilleries, it was then created the first group of Lowlands distilleries, which became the Distillers Company Limited, the Whisky industry giant.</p>
					  	<p>Towards the end of the nineteenth century, there was recorded a sensible growth of Scotch Whisky industry, due to the spread in 1880 of phylloxera in the French vineyards that made almost disappeare the Cognac market. From this derived the opening of many new distilleries that, inevitably, brought down prices and, together with the beginning of World War I and the Prohibition in the United States in 1920, the situation seemed almost desperate.</p>
					  	<p>That difficult situation perpetrated even after the end of the war, because a few available cereals was neccesary to feed the population, and only around 1950, with return of the prosperity, the Whisky industry began to flourish.</p>
					  	<p>The production takes place in four areas of Scotland, divided as follows:</p>	
					  	<p>1 - Highlands, the land to the north by an imaginary line running from the east coast near Perth to the west coast just to the north of Dumbarton. This area, being very wide, produces Whisky with completely different characteristics that can be divided into five groups:</p>
					  	<p>Northern Highland, from Inverness area to the county of Wick, where produced Whisky are usually soft and not too peaty, have a range of flavors to the palate that change from dry to fruity and don't show that salty aftertaste of Single produced in the areas swept by ocean winds of the west coast;</p>	
					  	<p>Southern Highlands, around the County of Perth and to the west of it, have a softer and lighter character;</p>
					  	<p>West area, from Oban to Fort William, produces mellow and slightly smoked Whisky;</p>
					  	<p>Island, the Scotch Malt Whisky Society includes in the Island also Orkney Islands, with Highland Park and Scapa, with its characteristic peat mixed to heather, the island of Mull, with light Tobermory and peat Ledaig, the Isle of Skye with its only one distillery producing Talisker, with the particular marine flavor, and the island of Jura with its sweet and spicy namesake;</p>
					  	<p>Speyside, the heart of the production of Scotch Whisky, there are produced pure malts such as Macallan, Glenlivet, Glen Grant. The city of Elgin, Keith, Dufftown, Grantown are all between the Spey Valley and three main confluents: the Avon, the Livet and the Fiddich, that provide excellent water neccessary for production;</p>
					  	<p>2 - Islay, an island in the Hebrides archipelago, is characterized by a soil consisted almost entirely of peat that, used during the malting process, brings a unique taste of smoke and algae. There are eight active distilleries products of which can be grouped into two families: Bowmore, Caol Ila, Bruichladdich, Port Ellen and Bunnahabhain, fresh, floral, with a light hint of peat; Lagavulin, Ardbeg and Laphroaig, strong, powerful, very peaty and with traces of seaweed and salt, as the Atlantic tide reaches sometimes the cellars where the Whisky ages;</p>
					  	<p>3 - Campbeltown lies in the Mull of Kintyre, a peninsula to the southwest of Scotland. The town once was famous for its 32 distilleries. Excessive production led to the gradual disappearance of the many distilleries and only three of them survived: two Single Malt as Glen Scotia, peaty and oily, and Springbank, a classic malt rich in flavor, and  one Grain, the Longrow.</p>
					  	<p>4 - Lowlands, under the imaginary line from Dumbarton to Perth, characterized by a few rocks, a few waterfalls, no mountains or peat moors.</p>
					  	<p>The produced Whisky show a soft sweetness of the malt and fruity of yeast, with very dry notes and a reasonably volatile and alcohol quality.</p>
					  	<p>The main producers are: Auchentoshan, which produces triple distilled single malt, fresh and slightly sweet aroma; Bladnoch, which produces Whisky with scent of lemon and fruity aftertaste; Glenkinchie, which produces a dry, smoky and full-bodied Whisky ; Inverleven that produces soft malt Whisky, with a good balance between dry and sweet flavors; Littlemill, which produces soft, malty and tasty Whisky; Rosebank, which produces a delicate, fruity Whisky with notes of Sherry, St Magdalene, which produces Whisky with a light, soft and dry body.</p>
					  	<p>There are six phases of producing Whisky:</p>
					  	<p>Malting, the malting process begins with the first phase called maceration, which consists in dampening barley in tanks, called steeps, for a period between 48 and 70 hours depending on the season of the year and quality of the used barley. At this point, the kernels are saturated and reached the desired degree of humidity of at least 47%, in these conditions the embryo is ready to germinate: the water is drained and the grain is spread on floor that can be made of stone, concrete or tile, called "malting floor", here the germination takes place, a process during which the barley absorbs oxygen emitting carbon dioxide and generating heat, which should develop only within the grain and should be blocked before appearing of a new plant.</p>	
					  	<p>During this stage the barley excretes the enzyme diastase that solubilizes the starch in it, preparing it for the conversion into sugar.</p>
					  	<p>At the end of germination, which can last up to 12 days, there is a maximum conversion of starch from insoluble to soluble and barley is placed in hot air ovens to be dried and at the same time, to stop the germination, obtaining malted barley.</p>	
					  	<p>As fuel it is generally used peat that produces a heavy, greasy, pungent and penetrating smoke that is of primary importance because it confers the characteristic aroma to malt;</p>
					  	<p>Mashing, infusion, the dried malt is now coarsely ground in a mill and mixed with hot water in a container called a "mash-tun."</p>
					  	<p>From the maceration container the malt is extracted three or four times and then replaced back, every time at a different temperature, which ranges from 70°C of the first extraction to 80°C of the last.</p>
					  	<p>It is the malt wort: a liquid semi-transparent, not yet alcohol, with a strange sweet smell, where the soluble starch of malted barley is converted into a sugary liquid;</p>
					  	<p>Fermentation, the wort is heated to a temperature of about 20°C and placed in the wash-back, huge wood or glassblock vats, and also of stainless steel, together with the yeast.</p>
					  	<p>Immediately begins the fermentation process in which the yeast, fermenting maltose in the wort, convert sugar into ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide.</p>
					  	<p>After a period ranging from a minimum of 48 hours to a maximum of 112, it is obtained a clear liquid called wash, consisting of water, yeast, non-fermentable residues, by-products of fermentation and alcohol in an amount equal to about 6% volume;</p>
					  	<p>Maturation, the obtained distillate, pungent and colorless, before being put in barrels is diluted with water to an alcohol volume of 64.5%.</p>
					  	<p>The casks, where the aging takes place, are American oak casks that matured Bourbon Whiskey, or Spanish oak casks that contained the Sherry wine. The oak, being porous, can absorb and retain a good amount of the elements of a distillate or wine and, therefore, it can then be transmitted to the new distillate. Among characteristic elements are the tannins, vegetable substances with properties, which give to the distillate color, floral and fruity aromas, and vanillin, that gives to the Whisky its perfumes. A barrel that contained Bourbon Whiskey will give to the single malt a golden color, full of aromas and flavors typical of the sweet corn. A Spanish barrel, instead, will give a stronger amber color and particularly persistent, rich and caramelized aromas and flavors.</p>
					  	<p>The rate of aging is inversely proportional to the size of the barrels: the smaller is the size, the faster is the speed.</p>
					  	<p>Not all malts, however, age in the same way: Whisky from Highland or Islay ripen slowlier and are more long-lived, unlike the ones from Lowland and Campbeltown that evolve more rapidly.</p>
					  	<p>The climate is also critical in determining the characteristics of Whisky: if the aging warehouses are located on coasts or on islands the Whisky is influenced by the sea. The Whisky that matures in Speyside, the Highlands has the characteristics acquired from the pure air and  is rich of aromas, while the milder climate of the Lowlands contributes to the creation of Whisky with delicate aromas and flavors.</p>	
					  	<p>During the maturation there is a loss of volume due to evaporation of the distillate through the pores of the staves, but also a loss of strength.</p>
					  	<p>Generally the aging takes place in the same barrel for the entire period, some manufacturers sell, however, bottles of double or triple matured Whisky, matured in two or three barrels of different types. Some manufacturers indicate with the word finishing a passage in the final period of aging to barrels that contained other spirits, such as Porto or Marsala;</p>	
					  	<p>Filtering and Bottling, finisced the period of maturation Whisky, before being bottled, is diluted with water to bring the alcohol by volume to about 40,45%. The dilution process is directly connected to the cold filtering process: the lowering of the alcohol content without cold filtering produces, in fact, a more turbid distillate due to the presence of glycerin.</p>
					  	<p>Scotch Whisky is usually divided into two main categories:</p>
					  	<p>Malt Whisky, produced only with malted barley with Pot Sill;</p>
					  	<p>Grain Whisky, produced with mixed cereals through patent still process.</p>
					  	<p>It is also possible to rank different types:</p>
					  	<p>Single malt, Whisky produced in one distillery and only with one malt quality. It is obtained by mixing the contents of several barrels of different vintages, usually the used products matured between 8 and 15 years, produced by the same distillery. The indication of aging on the bottle corresponds to  the youngest spirit in the blend;
						</p>
					  	<p>Single Cask  or Single Barrel or Single-Single malt, obtained by a single distillation and aged in a single barrel;</p>
					  	<p>Blended, blend of Whisky of different malts and grain from different distilleries, in order to obtain a final product balanced in terms of taste and quality. This type of Whisky was born in the nineteenth century when the Scotish began to export beyond the borders, it became necessary to soften the too strong taste of a "single malt" for the palates not accustomed to such drinks;</p>
					  	<p>Vatted malt, obtained by mixing malt Whisky from different distilleries to get a taste softer than a taste of a single malt;</p>
					  	<p>De luxe, indicates the high quality blended, those with a greater proportion of aged Whisky;</p>
					  	<p>Liqueur, Whisky mixed with honey and flavored with herbs, fruits, spices, or mixed with coffee or chocolate. The are not considered as Scotch Whisky.</p>
					  	<p>Double Malt, obtained by mixing two single malt, typically with different geographical characteristics. Can not be considered as a Scotch Whisky. The term Double Malt is little used because usually a mixture of several single malt is considered a blend in all respects.</p>

							<h3>Bourbon</h3>
							<div style="float:right;"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/content/bourbon.jpg"/></div>
							<p>Whiskey birth of which is attributed to the Reverend Elijah Craig in 1789 and name of which comes from the homonymous county of the state of Kentucky, USA. The first Bourbon similar to today's one is thought to have been produced by James Crowe in 1835. It can be distilled only in the United States of America and its production is concentrated in the following states: Kentucky, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Georgia.</p>

							<p>In 1964 Congress recognized Bourbon Whiskey as a characteristic product of the USA, creating the Federal Standards of Identity for Bourbon which provide that: it must be obtained from a grain mixture consisting of at least 51% of corn; it has be distilled not over than 80% alcohol by volume; it must be 100% natural, to the mixture can be added only water; it should be aged in American oak barrels, new and toasted to simplify penetration of the distillate in the wood, for a minimum of two years; it must be put in barrels with no more than 62.5% alcohol by volume; it must be bottled with an alcohol volume not less than 40%.</p>

							<p>The Whiskey that follows these rules, if aged for a minimum of two years, is called Straight Bourbon and on the label must be given the age of the youngest Whiskey; the name Kentucky Bourbon refers to a Whiskey distilled and aged for at least one years in Kentucky.</p>

							<h3>Rum</h3>
							<div style="float:right;"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/content/rum.jpg"/></div>
							<p>Spirit obtained from the distillation of the juice of sugar cane or from the distillation of molasses.</p>
							<p>The first evidence of fermented beverages from sugar cane juice come from ancient India and China. In a document of the fourteenth century, Marco Polo speaks of a "good wine of sugar" that was offered in the current Iran.</p>
							<p>In 1493, during his second voyage to the New World, Christopher Columbus brought with him the plant, that grow in the Canary Islands, importing it in the island of Hispaniola (now the territory of the Dominican Republic and Haiti) where he began planting Caribbean sugar cane. It was later planted in Puerto Rico, Cuba, Jamaica, Brazil (since 1510), Mexico (in 1519, with Cortes) and Peru (in 1533, with Pizarro).</p>
							<p>The enslaved natives in a few years reached the almost total extermination because of poor living conditions, malnutrition and the contraction of diseases of European descent: this suggested the settlers to import slaves from Africa to work in the plantations.</p>
							<p>The Antilles and the Caribbean, resource-poor, were ignored by the Spanish and were only later colonized by the British and the French after the "Invencible Armada" (Invincible Army) dating back to 1588: the French settled in Martinique and Guadeloupe since 1635, while the British implanted the first sugar industry in Barbados in 1627; the first distillation of Rum took place right here.</p>
							<p>The slaves working in the mills crushing sugar cane first discovered that molasses, a by product of the sugar refining, left in the vats in the open air fermented in alcohol.</p>
							<p>Thus were born the first distilleries fed with bagasse, the fiber waste of sugar cane that are even an excellent fuel, which began the production of Rum.</p>
							<p>The sugar cane plantations found, in this way, a new placement as the sugar market was saturated, thus providing material for the distillation of what initially took the name of Aguardiente de Caña.</p>
							<p>A document dated 1651 from Barbados stated that "The most intoxicating product on the island is Rumbullion, also known as Kill-Devil (Devil-Slayer), made from sugar canes distilled, a hot, hellish and terrible liquor".</p>
							<p>The British call this drink "Rum", which could result from rumboiling or rumbullon, slang voices referring perhaps to the noise of boilers distillation (from "rumble" bubbling and "boil", in French "Bouillie", boil) or a simplification of sacca rum, used by the monks and derived from "saccharum" (Saccharum officinarum: scientific name of sugar cane). The first official mention of the name "Rum" appeared in an order of the Governor General of Jamaica, dated July 8, 1661. </p>
							<p>Sugar cane originated in New Guinea, where it grows spontaneously today. It gradually spread to Asia Minor, where Alexander the Great discovered it in 325 BC.  The first news of the arrival on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea are described by Pliny the Elder, who mentions it as Saccarum, from sanskrit Sarkara. The Arabs introduced it into Spain and, with the discovery of the New World, began its great development.</p>
							<p>The cultivated variety of sugar, known as Saccharum officinarum, grows in tropical climates with a cycle of 14-16 months. It looks like a big bamboo that can be white, yellow, green or purple depending on the variety; the flowers are collected in a large panicle, white, greyish or purple on the top of the stem. The leaves are very long, linear and rugged; the plant has underground rhizomes with many stems cylindrical, gnarled and flexible that can be as high as 6 m, with a diameter which can vary between 2 and 7 cm.</p>
							<p>Reproduction of the cane is by cuttings. The plant grows in height and foliage up to 12 months and like all green plants, through photosynthesis, produces sugars accumulating in the stalk, which serve as an energy source for various metabolic processes.</p>
							<p>It is a long-lived plant that can live for up to 20 years but in plantations usually rhizomes are renewed every 5 years.</p>
							<p>During the dry season, from February to June, the cane reaches maturity (18 months), and this is the time when the sugar concentration is maximum. Thus begins the collection, which is done almost exclusively by hand in most of the plantations, in order to obtain fascines well cleaned from the leaves and to the ends and, consequently, replant the cuttings.</p>
							<p>The stalk of the cane contains 14% of woody material, 70% of water, 14% of sucrose and 2% of impurities. Within hours the plant should be sent to milling in order to keep it from drying in the sun, triggering a process of fermentation.</p>
							<p>It is here that we found the first major difference between types of Rum. The juice can be extracted for the production of sugar, whose residues (molasses) will then be sent to the fermentation, creating an Industrial Rum, or the extracted from the cane with the grinding ("vesou" in French, "guarapo" in Spanish) can be sent directly to the fermentation, producing no sugar and thus obtaining an Agricultural Rum.</p>
							<p>Agricultural Rum - was in central America between St. Bartholomew, Guadeloupe and Martinique which, around 1870, this quality was born to address the crisis in the sugar market.</p>
							<p>The fresh juice of the cane is fermented with added yeast for a minimum of 24 hours to a maximum of 15 days, depending on the type of Rum you want to achieve: with a fermentation of a short period we will have a product with light aroma, containing just a few acids and heavy organic residues; with a longer fermentation, the product obtained is a liquid containing a higher dose of alcohol, acids, and residues that distill Rum full-bodied and flavored.</p>
							<p>You get a "wine" from 5-6% vol. which is distilled immediately. They are generally used continuous stills, but in some cases, you can still find traditional stills.</p>
							<p>We can make a big distinction between "grappe blanche", an "Agricultural Rhum" not aged with a light body, and "Rhum Vieux", aged in barrels for at least three years, tending to dark brown with more body and softer.</p>
							<p>Since 1996, the Rhum Agricole in Martinique has obtained the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée from the French Republic which provides three categories:</p>
							<p>Rhum Agricole AOC Martinique Blanc, diluted with spring water after a period of three months in huge wooden vats;</p>
							<p>Rhum Agricole AOC Martinique Élevé Sous Bois, quality gold, amber color, due to the aging period of at least twelve months in barrel and, at times, with a slight correction of caramel and sugar noble cane;</p>
							<p>Rhum Vieux Agricole AOC Martinique, matured in oak barrels takes the name of the VO (Very Old) after the first three years, V.S.O.P. (Very Superior Old Pale or Rhum trés vieux) after four years and vintage X.O. (Extra Old or Rhum hors d’âge) over six years.</p>
							<p>Industrial Rum - is the traditional quality and the most produced in the world.</p>
							<p>The vesou, after being purified with whitewash, is heated to make insoluble its mineral acids and other organic materials.</p>
							<p>With a vacuum evaporation is deleted a part of the water and for cooking is crystallized sucrose that is separated by a centrifuge.</p>
							<p>The result is the molasses, sugar not composed of crystallizable (glucose, fructose, sugars, etc..). Themolasses, with the addition of yeast, begin the process fermentation at the end of which you can perform the distillation. This will take place in large industrial columns stills or in pot stills from which you will get a distilled alcohol content varies between 65-75% vol. </p>
							<p>The extraction method of vesou is one of the basic steps to get a quality Rum. Where the mining methods are rudimentary Rum is richer and where the extraction is completed, as in the British Antilles, you will have a kinder Rum.</p>
							<p>The Industrial Rum just distilled is a white clear liquid whose flavors are already there but not easily distinguishable. They are then left to mature in traditionally American oak casks, which are prepared by charring the inside. The distillate, still young, once in the barrel penetrates into the pores of the wood, taking on some flavorings, and releasing some of the alcohol cause the exchanges between the distillate vapor with the air outside. This process gives stability to the distillate, removing the most volatile parts and building a drink with a better body and a defined aroma. Even in the case of the Industrial Rum, we have a "Vieux Rhum" with at least three years aging in barrels.</p>
							<p>In general, Rums can be divided into the following categories:</p>
							<p>Rum White, transparent or clear, slightly scented with a hint of sweetness.</p>
							<p>Usually aged for a period ranging from three to twelve months, is filtered with activated carbon to remove slightly amber color acquired from contact with wood. An exception is Rhum Agricole Blanc, ages even up four years and presents a full body. They have 40% alcohol by volume;</p>
							<p>Rum Gold, light copper in color, age for a couple of years in oak casks previously used for aging Bourbon. Rhum Agricole AOC Martinique Élevé Sous Bois are used instead casks where have matured Brandy or Cognac;</p>
							<p>Rum Dark, full-bodied with hints of caramel. The best are obtained with a pot stills and in some cases small amounts of caramel are used to correct the color acquired from aging in barrels.</p>
							<p>Rum Aged, tones that vary depending on whether a clear, dark añejo or a solera. They are obtained from the wise mixture of master winemakers of different crops product and different vintages bake in still. According to the regulations in force in the country of the manufacturer the number on the label may indicate the product contained in the blend younger or older.</p>
							<p>Rum Vintage, which are obtained from products related to a specific year of harvest is shown on the label;</p>
							<p>Rum Overproof, with high alcohol content, reach up to 75% vol., Are intended for mixing;</p>
							<p>Rum Spicy, made with a distillate base enriched with infusions of fruit and spices. Among the most commonly used are vanilla, cinnamon and lemon.</p>

							<h3>Tequila</h3>
							<div style="float:right;"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/content/tequila.jpg"/></div>
							<p>Spirit native of Mexico, obtained from the distillation of fermented juice of agave azul or agave Tequilana.</p>

							<p>The agave is a plant of the family Agavaceae with thorny leaves. By Mexican law the agave distillate can be defined Tequila only if produced from a particular type of agave, "agave azul" (Weber Agave Tequilana), grown in specific geographical areas: the federal state of Jalisco in Central-West Mexico.</p>

							<p>In the language of the local tribes Nahuatl the word Tequila means Volcano.</p>

							<p>The distillates obtained from the fermented juice of other species of agave are called Mezcal and are produced all over the Mexico.</p>

							<p>The Aztec legend tells that the god Quetzalcoatl, worried about the sadness that afflicted the men of the earth, made the goddess Mayahuel fall in love with him to lead her on earth, on the wings of the wind, in order to give men her extraordinary beauty. The grandmother of the goddess, enraged, directed to earth with an army of stars, to find her. The god Quetzalcoatl, to protect his beloved from the fury of her grandmother, picked her up and turned themselves into a tree, the branches of which were the body of his beloved. The grandmother of the Goddess, even more irritated by the attempted deception, ordered lightning and thunderbolts on the tree. The branches caught fire and burned. The god Quetzalcoatl, that came out from the trunk of the tree, picked up and bury the inert remains of the body of the goddess Mayahuel. From her limbs grew, as the fruit of not won love, the Agave plant, the plant of the gods, from heart of which the sacred water gutters that put an end to the sadness of men and women of the earth.</p>

							<p>The origins of Tequila and Mezcal go back to two thousand years ago. Around the first century AD, the locals discovered that the juice of the agave plant, when exposed to air, fermented in a milky mildly alcoholic beverage. The Aztecs called it "octyl poliqhui", a name that was later transformed by the Spanish in "pulque".</p>

							<p>As mentioned in the Aztec culture drinking "pulque" had a religious significance. It was consumed during public holidays when large containers full of pulque were arranged in squares. The ruling class, however, had the privilege of enjoying the drink throughout the year. It was even offered to prisoners of war to be purified before being sacrificed to the gods.</p>

							<p>The "conquistadores", that arrived in Mexico in the sixteenth century, initially did not like this drink of low alcohol content from about 3% by volume, with earthy and vegetable taste. They took with them, however, the stills and knowledge in the distillation. The first attempts to distill pulque were not exciting: the distillate had a sour and pungent taste; they had, then, the idea of cooking the agave pulp. The result was a sweeter juice which, when fermented, became known as Mezcal Wine. Once distilled was born the first Mezcal as we know it.</p>

							<p>The village of Tequila (named by the local Indians Ticuilas) produced Mezcal already at the seventeenth century. This spirit, made with the local agave azul, had a taste superior to others produced in the rest of Mexico and barrels of Mezcal wine of Tequila soon began to be marketed with the near Guadalajara and other cities even farther away. Gradually Mezcal  produced in the future area of Jalisco came to be known as Tequila.</p>

							<p>The oldest distilleries in the town of Tequila date back to 1795, when the Spanish Crown granted a distiller license to Mr. Jose Cuervo. In 1805 was founded the distillery which became of the Sauza family.</p>

							<p>The distillation method for the Tequila and Mezcal is very similar. The agave reaches maturity after a time that varies between 8 and 10. Reached this it produces a flower stalk that, once started to grow, is cut by the farmer who directs back the growth in the central stem of the plant, causing swelling in the form of large bulb. When the bulge reaches the desired size, the plant is cut from the roots and spiny leaves are removed using a tool similar to a razor called the "coa". What remains it is the piña, which looks like a giant white and green pineapple weighing between 12 and 45 kg, full of sweet, juicy pulp.</p>

							<p>Arrived in the distillery Piñas are divided into four. As for Tequila, the starch content in the pulp is converted into sugars due to the heat of steam ovens or of large pressure cookers applied slowly.</p>

							<p>For what concerns Mezcal, the trasformation is obtained with underground ovens heated with charcoal, that gives the drink its characteristic smoky taste.</p>

							<p>After being cooked, they are crushed with a stone wheel, driven by a mule, to extract "the aguamiel", honey water.</p>

							<p>To obtain high-quality Tequila just agave juice mixed with a little water is fermented and distillated. When, besides water, are added sugars from various sources, such as cane, we will have a final product that will be defined as "mixto".</p>

							<p>The "mixto" produced and bottled in Mexico can contain up to 40% alcohol derived from other sugars, while those sent to foreign countries for bottling, especially in the United States, may have an agave content reduced by the foreign bottler to 51%.</p>

							<p>Mexican law establishes that Tequila 100% agave or aged Tequila has to be bottled in Mexico and that this feature should always be reported on the label of the bottle. If it is a "mixto", however, it is usually not mentioned on the label.</p>

							<p>The stills used for distillation are discontinuous and produce a clear distillate, containing a significant amount of spices, which can be distilled again in column pot stills to get a distillation cleaner and lighter.</p>

							<p>The color is generally enhanced by the addition of caramel, because the color from aging in the barrel is the exclusive prerogative of high quality brands. Some distillers add small amounts of natural flavorings such as prunes, coconut or Sherry, which, even if not significantly affect the taste of spirit, soften it changing the flavor profile.</p>

							<p>Tequila can be divided in four categories:</p>

							<p>Tequila Silver or Blanco, light in color, can be either 100% agave or mixto. It is not aged, just a slight aging in stainless steel containers for up to 60 days, it is indicated mainly for mixing;</p>

							<p>Tequila Gold, even this is not aged: is colored and flavored with caramel. Normally it is a mixto;</p>

							<p>Tequila Reposado, is aged in wooden casks or vats for a minimum period established by Mexican law, for two months. The best brands age from 3 to 9 months in wood casks. It can be either 100% agave or mixto and is the kind of best-selling Tequila in Mexico.</p>

							<p>Tequila Añejo is aged in wooden barrels (usually old barrels used for Bourbon) for a minimum of 12 months. The best Añejo are aged for 18 months to 3 years for mixto and even up to 4 years for 100% agave. Age Tequila for more than 4 years is a controversial matter. Many producers of Tequila are opposed because they believe that too much time in wood can cover the earthy and vegetal aromatic features of agave.</p>

							<p>The rules and regulations that govern the production and packaging of Tequila are not applied to Mezcal. Some distilleries are very primitive and very small. The most famous Mezcal is produced in the southern state of Oaxaca. Eight varieties of agave are allowed for the production of Mezcal, but the mainly used variety is agave "espadin" (Agave angustifolia Haw).</p>

							<p>In some bottles of Mezcal it is possible to find the "gusano", in English worm, which is actually the larva of one or two months that grows in the agave plant. It is said that the "gusano" serves as a checker of alcohol content: if the worm remains intact in the bottle it means that the percentage of alcohol in the distillate is high enough to preserve it in alcohol. At the same time, however, it has become a ritual for generations, to consume the "gusano". It should be emphasized that the best bottles of Mezcal has none and, indeed, begin to have a remarkable character and the quality level allows its to capture a small slice of the market.</p>

							<p>It is custom to drink the pure Tequila eating immediately before, a pinch of salt and, soon after, a slice of lemon.</p>

							<p>The most common cocktails is undoubtedly Margarita. There are many stories around the creation of a cocktail so popular:</p>

							<p>Daniel Negrete (1936), according to what says his son Salvador Negrete, opened a bar at the Garci Crispo hotel with his brother David, and the day before David's marriage Daniel presented the Margarita as a wedding gift for his sister-in-law, Margarita;</p>

							<p>The bartender Francisco “Pancho” Morales, July 4, 1942, in a bar named Tommy's Place in Juarez, Texas, improvised a cocktail to a customer because he did not remember the exact recipe of Magnolia, cocktail that she had requested. His creation had success;</p>

							<p>Carlos Danny Herrera, between 1947 and 1948, mixed white Tequila with lemon juice and Triple Sec for a showgirl who called herself Marjorie King. The actress was allergic to liquors, except Tequila, but she did not liked to drink it with salt and lemon. The cocktail that was presented was called Margarita.</p>

							<h3>Mezcal</h3>

							<p>Distillate produced in Mexico obtained from the fermented juice of the agave fruit but not of agave azul, the type from which Tequila is produced.</p>

							<h3>Gin</h3>
							<div style="float:right;"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/content/gin.jpg"/></div>
							<p>Product of the distillation of grain flavored with juniper berries, coriander, licorice, angelica, broom and other plants.</p>

							<p>The tradition tells that Sylvius Franciscus, Dutch chemist, doctor and professor of the University of Leiden in the seventeenth century experienced a remedy to cure stomach and kidney ailments based on the administration of grain alcohol and juniper berries: it was born Jenever which then evolves into "Gin".</p>

							<p>This elixir immediately achieved success in Holland and soon arrived in England. The British did not stop at simply import but contributed to the development of this spirit, to turn it into an alcoholic beverage to be tasted at any time rather than only as a medicine. They put the berries directly in infusion, unlike the original recipe which provided using of berry oil, with coriander, orange peel and other plants to round the scent and taste: thus was born the "London dry Gin".</p>

							<p>His popularity had continuous growth that did not stop even during the period of Prohibition, set out with the promulgation of "Gin Act", a law that imposed a high tax on the drink trying to reduce consumption and production.</p>

							<p>This measure, of course, did not bring the desired results that monarchy expected but encouraged the illegal production and import from France and Netherlands, especially from the city of Schiedam, the name with which the British still identify the Dutch Gin.</p>

							<p>To face new problems, provoked by the prohibition, George II in 1742 decided to repeal the Gin Act and to begin a policy of fiscal control in order to promote competition between producers and consequently increase the level of quality.</p>

							<p>In early 1900 there was recorded a phenomenon that definitely revolutionized the concept of drinking: born the "Gin Palace". The grimy taverns were replaced by elegant and nicely furnished locals, frequented by the new social class, the bourgeoisie, that rose to prominence thanks to industrialization becoming one of the symbols of the Victorian era.</p>

							<p>It was born the habit of drinking Gin mixed with water, soda and lemon, which among the English settlers soon began, with the addition of cinchona, the famous tonic cocktail - Gin Tonic!</p>

							<p>The European directives recognize two methods of production of Gin: one made with distillation, which is used in Netherlands, and the other one with spirit aromatization, which is used in England.</p>

							<p>The first involves distillation with use of pot stills of cereal alcohol mixed with juniper berries and other aromatic plants. The result is a spirit with a robust body and very aromatic. After the second distillation it is obtained "double Gin".</p>

							<p>The second one starts from a base of neutral ethyl alcohol - 96% alcohol by volume - of whichever origin, that is flavored through the technique of maceration or percolation with juniper berries, coriander, licorice root, angelica, orris, cardamom, anise and fennel seeds, lemon and orange peel, cumin and almonds. After distillation the obtained result with continuous still, which gives that distinctive dry taste, it is created the "London dry Gin".</p>

							<p>There are several varieties of Gin:</p>

							<p>London Dry Gin, colorless, dry, aromatic, where you can find the words "premium" indicating a higher percentage of alcohol by volume;</p>

							<p>Old Tom Gin, made in England, colorless and slightly sweetened;</p>

							<p>Plymouth Gin, colorless, dry, with intense aroma with characteristic hints of roots, must be produced in the area of Plymouth, England.</p>

							<p>Golden Gin, aged in oak barrels which give it a light golden color;</p>

							<p>Jenever Gin, produced in Holland and perfected in characteristics earthenware bottles;</p>

							<p>Sloe Gin, with its characteristic purple color, slightly sweetened and flavored with wild plums;</p>

							<p>Pink Gin, flavored with Angostura;</p>

							<p>Orange and Lemon Gin, colorless and flavored with citrus essences.</p>

							<h3>Brandy</h3>
							<div style="float:right;"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/content/brandy.jpg"/></div>
							<p>Wine distillate produced throughout the world. The most accepted etymology is to be found in the abbreviation of English brandywine, derived in turn from the Dutch brandewijn, burned wine.</p>

							<p>Over the centuries it shortened in Brandy, its actual name all around the world. Brandy is produced in Russia, Latin America, U.S.A., France, Spain, Italy, South Africa and in all other countries that make wine.</p>

							<p>In Italy the production of Brandy has very remote origins. Among the first documents found there is the permission granted in 1583 by Emanuele I of Savoy to Horace Senese for the production of distillated  wine and in 1601 was born in Venice the Congrega dell'Università degli Acquavitai (Congragation of University of Distillers).</p>

							<p>Since no regulation regarding the production of Brandy existed in the past, in the years when in Italy was taking place an excessive production of wine, that one of poor quality was initiated to compulsory distillation: this, of course, gave birth to a poor quality alcohol. Various manufacturers acquired alcohol from the State, taking care only of aging and bottling with a result of poor quality spirits.</p>

							<p>This gave rise to the need for greater care in the selection of raw materials for the distillation, bringing to the constitution of the Committee of Italian Origin Brandy. It identified the regions and the best grape varieties to produce a Brandy of good quality: the area of the hills between Tuscany and Romagna and the grape Trebbiano Toscano and Trebbiano Romagnolo, characterized by good acidity and low alcohol content.</p>

							<p>This wine distillate can also use bases resulting from the fermented juice of other fruits, in most cases, however, is produced from wine grape. The grapes gently pressed are fermented at a temperature between 18°C and 22°C. Once completed the distillation stage begins the aging, which foresees at least one year in oak barrels. It's allowed the complementary aromatization with oak chips or other plants substances or add of the alcoholic infusion, which must not exceed 3%. It's available to sweeten the distillate up to 2% and add caramel.</p>

							<p>The percentage of alcohol by volume must be between 38% and 60%, and generally Brandy is sold at 40% of alcohol.</p>

							<h3>Apertifs</h3>
							<div style="float:right;"><img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/content/apertifs.jpg"/></div>
							<p>Dinner in a Frenchman's house can be an unnerving experience for an American. For one thing, no one ever seems to be in a hurry to eat. Although you may be greeted with fabulous kisses and a warm double welcome--Bienvenue! Bienvenue!--you're likely to be seated in the parlor, without any food in sight. Your host will kindly ask after your health, nodding Bien! Bien! to whatever you answer. (A true Frenchman repeats everything.) Then you will be poured an aperitif. Your first thought--and perhaps your second and your third--will be: When are we sitting down to eat? Shouldn't this dinner get going? This is the main usage for an apertif, an alcoholic drink taken before a meal to stimulate the appetite.</p>

							<p>But then you take a sip of your aperitif. It is light and refraissant, as the French would say, distinct from anything you have been served back home. And you'll wonder, Why don't they pour drinks like this in America? (The answer is that they do, but not often enough.) Suddenly, you will be in the very palm of the Frenchman's hand. You will happily eat when he tells you to, drink what he tells you to, and it will all take place at exactly the right time.</p>

							<p>I am a recent convert to aperitifs and what I call the aperitif way of life--which is another way of saying I am no longer in any hurry to eat. In fact, if there were one habit I could import from Europe to America, it would be the custom of the aperitif.</p>

							<p>For those who have never indulged in this sort of drink, here are a few basics: An aperitif (the word comes from the Latin aperire, "to open") is a light, most often dry, most often modestly alcoholic beverage meant to spark the appetite without overwhelming the senses. And while an aperitif may be as simple as a glass of dry white wine or Champagne, a true aperitif, the kind that I love, has a little more flair, more flavor, more color and--yes--a bit more sophistication. These are the aperitifs like Campari and Lillet, drinks that go (mostly) by one name and almost always are concocted from secret herbal recipes.</p>

							<p>CAMPARI Perhaps the most famous one-name aperitif of them all is Campari, the ruby red Italian drink whose recipe is guarded more carefully than the Vatican transcripts. In fact, its recipe has been a secret since 1860, when its creator, Gaspare Campari, first began bottling his product. But Campari didn't really take off until Gaspare's son Davide hired famous artists of the 1920s and '30s to make the now-legendary Campari ad posters.</p>

							<p>As for Campari itself, the drink is believed to contain rhubarb and ginseng, but I don't know for sure. What I do know is that Campari is very bitter, so bitter it's truly an acquired taste. But adding soda helps a great deal in the acquiring; in fact, a fair amount of chilled soda can open up Campari nicely, turning it into a more nuanced drink. (Ice is not necessary.)</p>

							<p>DUBONNET Although Dubonnet originated almost 150 years ago as a French aperitif, for the last half century, both the red and white versions we get in this country have been American-made--from California wine fortified with a touch of brandy. White Dubonnet is a dry white wine infused with herbs, while the red is sweet, flavored with spices and quinine. Although I'm generally a big fan of wine-based aperitifs, I have a little trouble with Dubonnet--it's a bit too syrupy to fit my ideal.</p>

							<p>LILLET And then there's Lillet. Another wine-based aperitif that also comes in red and white, Lillet is probably my favorite aperitif of all. (It was also a favorite of James Bond, who used to mix Lillet in his martini.) Made in a small town south of Bordeaux, Lillet tastes as swanky as it sounds. Perhaps it's the delicate combination of herbs, roots and fruits...but since the recipe is a secret, I'm not really sure. I prefer the rich, full-bodied white version, with its notes of candied orange and mint. (Classically, it is served with a twist of orange.)</p>

							<p>VERMOUTH Vermouth comes in both white (dry) and red (sweet) versions, and the best-known vermouth producers are Italian (Martini & Rossi, Cinzano) and French (Noilly Prat). Both dry and sweet are wine-based, herb-infused drinks. Of the two, sweet vermouth is the more novel aperitif, at least in the States, where we tend to think of it strictly as a component in a Manhattan. But Europeans drink it before a meal, chilled or on the rocks. Perhaps one of the most unusual vermouths is the Punt e Mes, an Italian delicacy, whose name means "point and a half," in reference to the old Italian custom of adding bitters, measured in "points" to vermouth.</p>

							<p>AND THE REST There are many other aperitifs, of course. There is, for example, a whole world of anise-based drinks like Pernod and Ricard. But while I know plenty of people who swear by them, I find these aperitifs a little too potent and forward for a predinner refreshment. I tend to like more delicate drinks like sherry (particularly the lighter finos) and Pineau des Charentes (a fortified wine from the Cognac region of France).</p>

							<p>All I know for certain is that the moment I taste the perfect aperitif--something light and refreshing--I just want to sit down for dinner with a Frenchman and follow his lead. I know we'll get to the meal eventually. But first, we'll work on our appetites. </p>
